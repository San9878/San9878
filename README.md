## 🐉 hi, I'm santiago hernández chávez

I'm an artificial intelligence engineering student with hands-on experience in computer vision, data structures, neural networks, and automation. I’m passionate about developing solutions that combine ai, embedded systems, and computer vision.

### 🌟 featured projects

- 🦾 **medical image classification with efficientnetb3**  
  trained on the kvasir-v2 dataset using fine-tuning, mixup, and label smoothing in google colab  

- 🛵 **vehicle speed analysis with yolo + bst**  
  vision-based detection and speed estimation, managed with binary search trees  

- 🌵 **automated greenhouse system**  
  controlled humidity, temperature, and lighting using arduino  

- 🦜 **robotic arm neural network training**  
  6-dof arm trained with matlab, reducing error from 20% to 9%  

- 🧃 **ai feedback collector**  
  receives prompts and ai-generated responses, allows human reviewers to rate and comment, and stores feedback securely using `supabase`. exposes restful endpoints via `fastapi`, uses `pydantic` for validation and `.env` for secret management. demonstrates practical skills in backend development, cloud integration, and real-world ai evaluation workflows.

### 🛠️ technologies

- languages: `python`, `c++`, `java`, `sql`, `assembly`  
- ai & data: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`
