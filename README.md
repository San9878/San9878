## 👋 hi, I'm Santiago hernández chávez

I'm an artificial intelligence engineering student with hands-on experience in computer vision, data structures, neural networks, and automation. I’m passionate about developing solutions that combine ai, embedded systems, and computer vision.

### 🚀 featured projects
- 🧠 **medical image classification with efficientnetb3**  
  trained on the kvasir-v2 dataset using fine-tuning, mixup, and label smoothing in google colab  
- 🚗 **vehicle speed analysis with yolo + bst**  
  vision-based detection and speed estimation, managed with binary search trees  
- 🌿 **automated greenhouse system**  
  controlled humidity, temperature, and lighting using arduino  
- 🤖 **robotic arm neural network training**  
  6-dof arm trained with matlab, reducing error from 20% to 9%

### 🛠️ technologies
- languages: `python`, `c++`, `java`, `sql`, `assembly`
- ai & data: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`
