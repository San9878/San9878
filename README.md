## 🐉 hi, i'm santiago hernández chávez

i'm an artificial intelligence engineering student with hands-on experience in computer vision, data structures, neural networks, and automation. i’m passionate about developing solutions that combine ai, embedded systems, and computer vision.

### 🌟 featured projects

- 🦾 **medical image classification with efficientnetb3**  
  trained on the kvasir-v2 dataset using fine-tuning, mixup, and label smoothing in google colab  

- 🛵 **vehicle speed analysis with yolo + bst**  
  vision-based detection and speed estimation, managed with binary search trees  

- 🌵 **automated greenhouse system**  
  controlled humidity, temperature, and lighting using arduino  

- 🦜 **robotic arm neural network training**  
  6-dof arm trained with matlab, reducing error from 20% to 9%

### 🛠️ technologies

- languages: `python`, `c++`, `java`, `sql`, `assembly`  
- ai & data: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`  
- computer vision: `opencv`, `yolo`, `efficientnet`  
- technical documentation: `latex`  
- automation: `arduino`, `ti microcontrollers`

### 🌱 currently

- studying ai at universidad panamericana  
- developing vision-based projects and structured data systems  
- automating and optimizing repetitive tasks

### ⚙️ project elaboration

this project was built to create a reliable system for collecting ai feedback through human review. it features:

- a **fastapi backend** that handles prompt submissions and stores ai-generated responses  
- a **secure supabase database** for storing feedback and user comments  
- **restful api endpoints** that allow easy integration and retrieval of feedback data  
- usage of **pydantic** for robust data validation and `.env` files to safely manage secrets  

it demonstrates practical skills in building production-ready apis, integrating cloud services, and contributing to ai model evaluation workflows like rlhf and prompt engineering.
